Welcome to the **All-in-One-Discord-Python-BOT** repository! This project features a versatile Discord bot built with Python, using `discord.py` and `Quart` for asynchronous operations, and integrates with `Google Gemini` and `ChatGPT` for advanced functionalities. `MongoDB` is used for data storage.

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Includes `start.sh` for Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and `start.bat` for Windows.
- **Secure Configuration**: Utilizes `.env` files for storing API keys and other sensitive data.
- **Advanced Integrations**: Combines Google Gemini and ChatGPT for enhanced conversational capabilities.
